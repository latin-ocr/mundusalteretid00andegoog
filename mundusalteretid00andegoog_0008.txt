Soura ten years ago this book could scarcely have

hoped sor a welcome. In the meantime matters have ἢ

moved rapidly. Science rs insisting more strongly on
her claims, and the old type of classical training is
doomed to disappear. This is not a missortune, buta
blessing in disguise. We have thrown aside much that

was merely the debris of pedantry. .The old Latin
grammar, with its masses os rules and exceptions, has

practically vanished ; and no one will regret its dis-
appearance. So we are able to approach the literature
almost at once, and teachers are casting about in
every direction sor easy and pleasant reading, with
which to introduce their pupils to the language.
Recently the Scotch Education Department called
attention to the dearth of such material, and suggested
that portions even of the Vulgate might be read in the
earliest stages. We believe that the present book will
be of value in the movement. It is not meant for the

very earliest stage of reading, but rather sor the. awk- ”

ward period which immediately precedes the reading os
difficult authors. That Caesar at least is unsuitable at
this stage we are convinced ; he is too impersonal to
be interesting, unless he can be read rapidly. Much
less can a boy be expected so soon to appreciate the
perfect form of Livy or Horace; he must first leel at
home in the language·
