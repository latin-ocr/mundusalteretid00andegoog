xiv lNTRODUCTlON

discovery in the distant South. Bacon’s New Atlantis
(published after his death in 1629) is but another mani-
festation of this belief ; as the Atlantis of the Ancients
foreboded the American continent, so the new Atlantis
implied foreboding of the Australian. So ‘Mercurius'
and his friends strike a bargain, and, after a dutiful ,
sarewell to their friends, embark' on the good ship

Phantasy and put forth into the unknown'sea. But soon .·

Beroaldus and Drogius disappear, leaving' Mercurius
to continue his voyage in solitude. Nothing daunted,
he sails on, and in two years, leaving the lsles of the
Blest sar behind him, sights the dusky headland of
Crapulia. Then follows sorthwith the record of all
that he saw and heard in this strange land. The last
part ol this charming introductory dialogue is given
in the text. g

With Hall’s theological and controversial writings we
have little to do: in their day they had a high repute,
and the Contemplattons on the Historical Passages in the
Natu Testament are well worth reading still fortheir
beauty and eloquence. But enough has been said to
prepare the Reader for the enjoyment ol the Mundus
Alter et Idem, whose satire will be found to have lost
little os its point. We may close with the first sentences ,,
of Knight's letter to‘ the Reader :-

‘Praeter spem, amice Lector, nec tempestatibus actus ”

nec diuturna maris iactatione lassatus, ¹sine ventis, sine
velis, in novum mundum appulisti. Ubi, postquam
terrarum amplitudinem, regionum situm, populorum
mores et ingenia, universi denique faciem et habitum
recte perlustraveris adeo huius veteris mundi formam
agnosces ut, licet alterum videaS, eundem tamen credas-
though it may look new, it is our old world after all l' .
