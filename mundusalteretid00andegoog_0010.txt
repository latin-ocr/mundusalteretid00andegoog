Latin would continue to be the literary language of
Europe. Since,then the national literatures have grown
to maturity (how much they have owed to the Classical

Renaissance, who can estimatell, and we now think
rather of, Latin as the language which reveals to us
a great past and its great thinkers, whom men ola
later day would be insensate indeed to put from them.
For in that past alone can we free ourselves srom the
narrowing bondage os the present.

Yet, hitherto, we have probably sought prematurely
to bring our pupils to the great classica} authors, before -
their perlection os form or their ideas could be intelli-
gible to them. Far better to begin with a book like the
present, which, while sull of the classical spirit, yet,
from its subject, moves within the circle of famihar
ideas ; lor it is modern vices and foibles which Hall
attacks. We are fortunate, il we will but avail ourselves
of it, in having such a work, to form, as Lucian does in
Greek, a ste'ppingstone to the great classical authors
And it is not merely a means to an end: it is itself
a literary masterpiece. ⁴

We would not suggest that the book should neces·
sarily be the main reading of a class, and there are
aster all simple classical authors, small portions of
whom could well be read at the same time and might
even be made the ‘core ’ of careful reading, e. g. Pliny’s
Letters in a selection. A page of the Mundus, read
fairly quickly by a master with a clasS, would be a
welcome relies, and--what is our main point-would
lead pupils unconsciously deeper into the language.
This being the purpose we have had in view, the
notes given are of the briefest. But there is a com·
plete vocabulary, and the index os proper names
