HIS Course is written on the lines recommeuded by the Classical

Association, and adopted by the Board os Education. The commonly
used grammar only is taught (rare usages excluded); all grammar is taught
gradually as the exercises proceed ; and the exercises are made interesting.
Iu one point the editors claim to have gone further than the recommendations : -
viz. in the English into Latin exercises. These are consecutive and make
sense, and they exemplisy the rules being taught. Moreover the English into
Latin corresponds with the Latin into English-a valuable innovation, as it
helps to fix the vocabulary and the rnles, and to correlate all the knowledge.

Latin Course in'three parts. The whole os the matter has been thoroughly
revised‚ and all the necessary grammar is given at the beginning. Many
sentences have been discarded, especially ¹from the first part, so that the
progress iu grammar is more rapid, but the special features of the Latin Conrse
remaiu as they were.
