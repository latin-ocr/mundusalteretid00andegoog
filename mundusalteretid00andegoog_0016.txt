INTRODUCTlON xiii

Drogius They discuss the advantages oi foreign travel,
a subject which Hall has treated also in an independent
work ‘Quo vadisi-A just censure of travel, as it is
undertaken by the gentlemen of our nation ³.. Beroaldus,
who has already travelled iar and seen many lands,
expresses contemptos socalled travel. For, he says,
‘Si limen patrium transire, terram tuae proximam cal·
care, fretum aliquod angustius aut flumen (ut Twedam‚

Rhenumve) transnavigare, hoc sibi nomen, ut vulgo

and devour him yet alive and trembling’. But Beroaldus
will not be gainsaid: Seneca's prophecy, ii such it was,
‘Venient annis ¹Saecula seriS, quando Oceanus vincula
rerum laxet, et ingens pateat tellus,' might have reler-
ence to later discoveries than that ol Columbns; and
finally he overcomes all their seruples by a triumphant
appeal to their love of adventure. All this breathes
the very spirit of the time. We are still in the spacious
days ol Elizabeth; men selt that fresh lands awaited
